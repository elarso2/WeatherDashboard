This weeks assignment is to create a weather dashboard, which allows a user to input a city and retrieve weather data for that city. It utilizes two third party API's, one is a Geocoding API which returns the latitude and longitude of the city a user enters, and the other is a daily weather API which uses that latitude and longitude response to pull the current and future weather for the user's selected city.

We were given the following image as a guide for our page:
